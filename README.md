# Itanki-and-Ankiego-Method-Version-2.0
Here is what has been introduced:  Box setting one opens when all the due cards and cards in the learning queue across all decks are 0.  The other box setting uses the "variable ratio schedule" of reinforcement. So it opens on average every nth due card no longer due, but not always on the nth response. Nth response means, e.g. getting 50 cards on average no longer due for each day. Imagine today I finish 25 cards (finish meaning they are no longer due today), then it opens. Tomorrow I complete 80 cards, and on the 81st, it opens. Over the month, the average is 50 cards.  You can only specify what the nth number will be and the range of possible random values once a month.   Closing a box causes it to be forced shut. To ensure people sleep properly, specify a cooldown time (default is 10 AM to 6 AM; the boxes will not open).   The anti-cheat functions aim to remove the possibility of rewarding behaviour that you can easily fake to make the cards less cheatable. I think designing things to be less cheatable/remove temptation is always ethical:  Cards can only be deleted and edited once a month. You can always add cards.  The second anti-cheat is for the basic (type in the answer) card. The show card again option only shows if the answer is more than a 70% correct match. Correct meaning word for word as the answer card is written. Otherwise, there is no option for hard, good etc., just again.
